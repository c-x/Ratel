Well, there is a few things to add :

- Read each log file only once
- Have a nice documentation and startup guide
- Change the way it's launched ("python ratel.py -c ." sounds better)
- Handle Ctrl+C (finish and clean threads) and much better, daemonize ratel with start/stop/reload options
- Rewrite all in C++/C
- Think about a multi-servers architectures
