Well, there is a few things to add :

- Read each log file only once
- Have a nice documentation and startup guide
- Change the way it's launched ("python ratel.py -c ." sounds better)
- Handle Ctrl+C (finish and clean threads) and much better, daemonize ratel with start/stop/reload options
- Rewrite all in C++/C
- Think about a multi-servers architectures
- Add an URL splitter at the parsing stage (like Faup) to populate extra fields (domain, port, url_file, subdomain, tld, etc)


Parsers community :
In order to prepare, and share, parsers, I need logs. So, please fill free to send me your samples :)
